description: "Initial extraction of facts from provider manual paragraphs"
variables:
  - paragraph_block
body: |
  You are extracting facts from a Medicaid/managed-care provider manual. Extract ALL relevant facts, not just eligibility-related ones.

  **Important:** Do NOT extract section headers, table-of-contents entries, or standalone titles as facts. Each "fact_text" must be a complete sentence or substantive statement (e.g. "Claims must be submitted within 90 days"), not a heading like "Benefits and covered services". If the paragraph is only a header or title with no body, return an empty "facts" array and a brief "summary" only.

  For each fact, provide:
  1. The standard categories (who_eligible, how_verified, conflict_resolution, when_applies, limitations)
  2. Category relevance scores (0.0 to 1.0) and directions for each category below

  **Category Relevance Scores (0.0-1.0) and Directions:**
  For each category, provide:
  - A **score** from 0.0 (not relevant) to 1.0 (highly relevant)
  - A **direction** (numeric): 1.0 = encourages (promotes/allows), 0.5 = neutral (just informs/notifies), 0.0 = restricts (limits/prohibits), or null (if not applicable)

  Categories:
  1. **contacting_marketing_members**: Related to contacting or marketing to members
  2. **member_eligibility_molina**: About eligibility of members to Molina policy
  3. **benefit_access_limitations**: About access or limitations of benefits to members
  4. **prior_authorization_required**: Services that require prior authorization
  5. **claims_authorization_submissions**: Requirements for claims, authorization, or other submissions
  6. **compliant_claim_requirements**: Requirements to be a compliant claim (e.g., timely filing, format requirements)
  7. **claim_disputes**: Claim disputes including underpayment, overpayment, denied claims
  8. **credentialing**: Provider credentialing requirements
  9. **claim_submission_important**: Other important things needed to submit claims
  10. **coordination_of_benefits**: Coordination of benefits information
  11. **other_important**: Other important information not covered above

  **is_pertinent_to_claims_or_members:** true if this fact is pertinent to submitting claims or working with members. False for provider-only administrative content, definitions, contact info, table of contents, or other content not directly relevant to claims submission or member interactions.

  **Examples:**
  - "Claims must be submitted within 90 days" → true (pertinent to submitting claims)
  - "Members must be notified of benefit changes" → true (pertinent to working with members)
  - "Provider must complete credentialing application" → false (provider administrative task)
  - "Contact information for provider services" → false (not pertinent to claims/members)

  **Source span (required for each fact):** Identify the exact span of text in the **provided paragraph** that this fact was derived from. Provide:
  - **source_start**: 0-based character index of the first character of that span in the paragraph text.
  - **source_end**: 0-based character index of the character *after* the last character (exclusive). So paragraph_text.slice(source_start, source_end) is the exact span. If the fact summarizes multiple disjoint phrases, use the most representative single span.

  Extract:
  1. A brief summary of this paragraph
  2. All discrete facts stated
  3. For each fact, provide the standard categories AND all category relevance scores with directions AND source_start/source_end

  Return JSON:
