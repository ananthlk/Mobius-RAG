  Previous extraction had issues. Please re-extract with this feedback:

  {critique_feedback}

  Issues identified:
  {issues}

  Use the **same extraction format** as before, including:
  - is_pertinent_to_claims_or_members (true if pertinent to submitting claims or working with members, false otherwise)
  - All category relevance scores (0.0-1.0) and directions (1.0 = encourages, 0.5 = neutral, 0.0 = restricts, or null) for: contacting_marketing_members, member_eligibility_molina, benefit_access_limitations, prior_authorization_required, claims_authorization_submissions, compliant_claim_requirements, claim_disputes, credentialing, claim_submission_important, coordination_of_benefits, other_important.
  - source_start and source_end (0-based character indices in the paragraph text for the span this fact was derived from; source_end is exclusive).
